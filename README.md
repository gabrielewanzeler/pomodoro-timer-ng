# PomodoroTimer ⏲️

About this project:
The Pomodoro Method is a time management method based on 25-minute periods (pomodoros) of focused study or work, interrupted by 5-minute breaks. After four consecutive study breaks, longer breaks are usually taken, which can range from 15 to 30 minutes. 


About Angular:
## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
